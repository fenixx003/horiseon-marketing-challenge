# Horiseon-marketing-challenge


## Description

The purpose of this project was to review, make any necessary changes and update the code provided by Horiseon Marketing for their website, which was not functioning properly. I also cleaned up the code as much as possible throughout the process. I learned how to consolidate the repeating image classes into one specific class name.
